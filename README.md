# Temperature-monitoring-and-controlling-system-with-alarm-and-Led-indicator
This was an interesting project where I did make a temperature monitoring and controlling system with alarm and led indicator. For that I did use Atmega128 microcontroller as my controlling board. My main component was a temperature sensor which take analog data of temperature and then according my code it converted to digital data and show on LCD display. I did set constant temperature at 30 degree Celsius, whenever temperature become more than 30 degree Celsius this time buzzer ringing and Led become red and this time automatically Cold air motor rotate and make the temperature 30 degree. Whenever temperature less than 30 degree this time buzzer ringing and Led become Blue and this time hot air motor rotate and make the temperature 30 degree.
